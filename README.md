## Install all dependencies

To start, install all the dependencies in the root, client, and server directory with this script!

```bash
npm run i-all
```

## Run both frontend and backend (Using Concurrently)

Open a terminal on root directory and run:

```bash
npm start
```

This should run the dev script on both frontend and backend simultaneously.
